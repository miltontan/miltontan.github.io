I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Emory University in the Department of Medicine supervised by <a href="https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/">Timothy D. Read</a> (Emory University) and <a href="http://alistairdove.com/">Alistair D. M. Dove</a> (Georgia Aquarium), where I am studying the whale shark genome. I received my Ph.D. from Auburn University, where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/~armbrjw/Armbruster_Lab/Armbruster.html">Jonathan W. Armbruster</a>. 

Why are there so many fish in the sea? In my research, I study the origin and evolution of fishes to understand their relationships, the evolution of traits in fishes including body size, and how fishes diversified. I study both the genome of the largest fish, the whale shark, and miniaturization in some of the smallest fishes. To do this, I use genomics to reconstruct evolutionary trees, and use comparative methods to infer how genomes and traits evolved and the pattern of diversification.
