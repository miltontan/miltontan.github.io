Since a young age, I have been inspired by the diversity in fishes and their huge variety in species and forms. There are roughly as many fish species as there are other vertebrates! In my research, I study the evolution of fishes to understand their relationships, their trait evolution, and how they diversified. To do this, I use genomics and comparative methods to reconstruct evolutionary trees and reconstruct how genomes and traits evolved.

## Whole Genome Analysis of the Whale Shark

{: .full}
The Whale Shark genome project is a collaboration between Emory University and Georgia Aquarium. Whale sharks are the largest species of fish, and one of the most charismatic fishes in the sea. Despite the wide interest in sharks, the whale shark genome represents the first published genome for any true shark. We have sequenced the whale shark genome, and will use it to understand the origin of vertebrates, the evolution of sharks, and the unique biology of the whale shark.

The order Cypriniformes is one of the most diverse groups of fishes, including over 4,000 species.

## Evolution and Diversification of Catfishes

The catfishes (Order Siluriformes) are a diverse group of fishes. Roughly one in twenty vertebrate species is a catfish! Through a recently-funded fellowship from the National Science Foundation, I will be using catfishes as a model system to study the evolution of defense mechanisms. 

## Fieldwork!

Part of what makes research so exciting is to be able to get out into the field to catch fish! I have been lucky to have numerous field experiences in the United States, Suriname, and Thailand. Catching fish isn't just stamp collecting, specimens serve as a primary source of data for my research, so that I can understand what species are out there, where they're found, and what they're genes and genomes are like. Specimens that I have collected have been preserved and stored in natural history collections at Auburn University and the Florida Museum of Natural History. To the left, you can see my inspect a vial of larval fishes in the Salween River, under the shadow of the mountains that form the eastern border of Myanmar.

## Adaptive Radiation in Fishes
Adaptive radiation is a classic process used to explain the diversity of species. If species evolved by adaptive radiation, then they should leave traces in the patterns of evolution of morphology, ecology, and diversification. However, these patterns have not been successfully recovered in many comparative datasets. In collaboration with Dr. Ed Burress, we are dissecting the patterns of evolution in fishes, especially cichlids, to gain insight into the role of ecology and morphology in their diversification.

## Taxonomy of Armored Suckermouth Catfishes

Many species remain unknown to science. For scientists to understand how biodiversity arose and the evolution of biodiversity, we must understand what is out there. To that end, I have helped describe numerous new species of catfishes from South America. To the left is a new species that we described, <i>Peckoltia greedoi</i>.
